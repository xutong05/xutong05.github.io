I am **Tong Xu (徐通)**, a PhD student at George Mason University, advised by Prof. [Xuesu Xiao](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/). I hold a M.S. Degree from University of Southern California and a B.E. Degree from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology. 

My primary research interests include robotics, reinforcement learning and off-road navigation. I have worked on visual odometry tasks with FlowNet pretrained structure and LSTM models when visiting Boston University.
