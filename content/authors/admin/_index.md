I am a third-year PhD student in [RobotiXX Lab](https://robotixx.cs.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University, advised by Prof. [Xuesu Xiao](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/). I received my Master's degree from University of Southern California and Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology. 

My primary research interests include robotics, reinforcement learning and foundation models. My current work on fast adaptation for cross-embediments reflects my dedication to advance real-world general-purpose applications in robotics through large-scale machine learning techniques.
