title: DeepVO
summary: Reproduced Deep Visual Odometry architecture by integrating a pretrained FlowNetSimple model with LSTM. Achieved 14.8% performance improvement through epoch optimization and 8.4% improvement through hyperparameter tuning in the loss function, evaluated on KITTI and nuScenes datasets using translation and rotation RMSE metrics.
